### Learning About Structs in C ðŸš€

**Structure ** is the element responsible for carrying information. Some types of structures include: multidimensional arrays, stacks, queues, lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, among others.
It is a set of variables under the same name, defined by the programmer. Each variable within a structure can be of a different type; in other words, it is not mandatory for all to be of the same type. In C, a 'struct' represents a record.
